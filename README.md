# 🧑‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm **Tal Simhayev** 👋

I'm a passionate Security Researcher focused on:
* **Reverse engineering**, exploit development, and vulnerability discovery 🔍
* Low-level system programming using **C/C++**, and **Python** 💻
* **Tools:** Ghidra, **IDA Pro**, Radare2, pwntools, and x86/x64 Assembly 🛠️

I've been programming since age 10, and over the years, I’ve developed a strong understanding of **Linux internals**, **binary exploitation** and **exploit development**.
I also regularly compete in CTF events.
My goal is to continue pushing the boundaries in **cybersecurity** and contribute to safer systems worldwide.
