# About

Hey there! I'm Tal Simhayev.

I'm passionate about Security Research and I'm eager to learn new technologies, especially on a low level perspective. 
I have a “think like a hacker” mindset, I've been programming since age 10, independent and self-taught.
I also participate in CTF events, where I gained experience with analyzing and reverse engineering binaries as well as finding vulnerabilities.

# CTF Write-ups & Blogs
I document all my CTF Experience [here](https://github.com/talsim/CTFs).
* [pingCTF 2023 dangle-me pwn challenge write-up](https://github.com/talsim/CTFs/tree/main/pingCTF-2023/dangle_me)
* I uploaded a blog to Medium: [ROP Emporium write4 - By Tal Simhayev](https://thehackerlife.medium.com/rop-emporium-write4-challenge-writeup-64-bit-updated-2020-742eab2722ec) - Manipulating gadgets to construct an arbitrary write (write-what-where condition) to process memory.


# Projects

* [Exploited Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195)](https://github.com/talsim/root-dirtyc0w) - Privilege escalation vulnerability in the Linux Kernel 
* [Implemented a KeyLogger in C/C++ using WinAPI](https://github.com/talsim/Keylogger) - Used Windows Hooking API to listen for keystrokes, and preserved hold on the computer by editing the registry to come up whenever the computer is turned on.
* [Implemented Linux shell](github.com/talsim/Linux-Shell)
* [HashMap](https://github.com/talsim/c-linked-list) and [LinkedList](https://github.com/talsim/Cpp-HashMap) implementations in C/C++
