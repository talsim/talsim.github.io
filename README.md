# 🧑‍💻 About Me 

Hey there! I'm **Tal Simhayev** 👋

I'm a passionate Security Researcher focused on:
* **Reverse engineering**, exploit development, and vulnerability discovery 🔍
* Low-level system programming using **C/C++**, and **Python** 💻
* **Tools:** Ghidra, **IDA Pro**, Radare2, pwntools, and x86/x64 Assembly 🛠️

I've been programming since age 10, and over the years, I’ve developed a strong understanding of **Linux internals**, **binary exploitation** and **exploit development**.  

I've also participated in lots of CTF events, mostly focused in categories like **binary exploitation** and **reverse engineering**. In these challenges I acquired hands-on experience and abilities to think critically under pressure, developing exploits that bypass modern defenses like **ASLR**, **DEP**, and **PIE**.  

🔒 **My goal** is to continue pushing the boundaries in **cybersecurity** and contribute to safer systems worldwide.



# Projects

### 🐄 [Exploited Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195)](https://github.com/talsim/root-dirtyc0w)

* **Privilege escalation vulnerability** in the Linux Kernel 🐧

* **Tools Used:** C, Linux Kernel

* Successfully crafted a PoC that exploits a race-condition in the kernel to achieve **root access**.


### 🔑 [KeyLogger (C/C++)](https://github.com/talsim/Keylogger)
* Used **Windows Hooking API** to log keystrokes 📃
* Implemented persistence through Windows Registry modifications 🗝️


### 🖥️ [Implemented Linux shell](https://github.com/talsim/Linux-Shell)
* Custom-built shell in **C**.
* A deep dive into **Linux Internals**.


### 🔢 [HashMap](https://github.com/talsim/Cpp-HashMap) & [LinkedList](https://github.com/talsim/c-linked-list) in C/C++

* Implemented core data structures like **HashMap** and **LinkedList** in C/C++ for efficiency and memory management.


# CTF Write-ups & Blogs
I document all my CTF Experience [here](https://github.com/talsim/CTFs).   There, I've gained hands-on experience in reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and vulnerability discovery.  
### 🛠️ [pingCTF 2023 dangle-me pwn challenge write-up](https://github.com/talsim/CTFs/tree/main/pingCTF-2023/dangle_me)

* Developed a working exploit for a memory corruption vulnerability

* Focused on **stack-based buffer overflows** and **Return Oriented Programming (ROP)** techniques

* Bypassed **PIE Mitigation** by **leaking addresses** from process memory

### 📝 [ROP Emporium write4 - Blog](https://thehackerlife.medium.com/rop-emporium-write4-challenge-writeup-64-bit-updated-2020-742eab2722ec)

* Crafted an **arbitrary write exploit** (write-what-where condition) to **inject data** to memory and bypass **DEP** protection mechanism

* Published on Medium, it showcases **how to chain ROP gadgets** effectively.
