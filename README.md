# About

Hey there! I'm Tal Simhayev.

I like Security Research and I'm eager to learn new technologies, especially on a low level perspective. 
I have a “think like a hacker” mindset, I've been programming since age 10, independent and self-taught.
I also participate in CTF events, where I gained experience with analyzing and reverse engineering binaries as well as finding vulnerabilities.
